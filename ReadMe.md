## Local Wind Report

Windr is a new type of weather application that focuses primarily on wind data. A user can create an account and set their local city and State, and once logged in, the user dashboard will display current wind dir using an animated weathervane. It will also display current maximum wind gusts as well as well as weather conditions conveyed through illustrations and woodcuts. For convenience, the current temerature is also displayed. <br><br>
## Sant Ana Wind Alerts
Windr has the ability to show alerts for certain wind conditions. The Santa Ana Winds in Los Angeles are inspiration for this feature. The winds in the Los Angeles County Basin typically blow in off the Pacific Ocean. Periodically, usually in the late summer and fall, the winds can shift dramatically and blow in from the mountains and high desert. The effects of these Eastern winds can be powerful. Many suffer from allergic reactions due to the pollins and particles in the air during the winds. For the many humans that suffer from these conditions, being notitifed so that can take precautions acordingly would be very helpful.

## Health Effects of Santa Ana Winds

Especially hot, dry, and dusty Santa Ana winds are widely believed (in Southern California, at least) to affect people's moods and behavior negatively. This has not been definitively proven in studies, although limited evidence may point to this conclusion.[18] Even without ironclad scientific proof, it is a well-accepted part of local lore.

The winds carry Coccidioides immitis and Coccidioides posadasii spores into nonendemic areas, a pathogenic fungus that causes Coccidioidomycosis ("Valley Fever"). Symptomatic infection (40 percent of cases) usually presents as an influenza-like illness with fever, cough, headaches, rash, and myalgia (muscle pain). Serious complications include severe pneumonia, lung nodules, and disseminated disease, where the fungus spreads throughout the body. The disseminated form of Coccidioidomycosis can devastate the body, causing skin ulcers, abscesses, bone lesions, severe joint pain, heart inflammation, urinary tract problems, meningitis, and often death.

## Purpose

Santa Ana wind alerts were the main purpose for Windr. However, to make Windr useful in other locations, it has been designed to convey wind-focused weather minimally in an untaylored, mobile friendly way. The alerts taylored to Los Angeles and the Santa Ana Winds are coded in one simple function in the Dashboard.jsx file. It can easily be manipulated to show alerts for unique conditions anywhere.
